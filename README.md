This project tackles the challenge of detecting political bias in online news articles and understanding its relationship with misinformation dissemination. By leveraging cutting-edge NLP and machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover ideological patterns and provide actionable insights into the dynamics of biased and misleading information in the media landscape.

## üîë Key Contributions

- Fine-tuned **BERT** and **SimCSE** for **multi-class political bias classification** (`left`, `center`, `right`) on a dataset of 34,000+ news articles, achieving robust accuracy and semantic alignment.
  
- Built **Logistic Regression** and **Deep Neural Networks** on **TF-IDF** and **Bag-of-Words** features:
  - Implemented multi-layer **ReLU architectures**
  - Used **dropout** for regularization
  - Trained with **categorical cross-entropy loss**
  - Provided baselines for transformer comparison

- Applied **K-Means** and **HDBSCAN** clustering on transformer-based sentence embeddings:
  - Discovered latent ideological clusters
  - Explored potential links between political bias and misinformation patterns
  - Enabled exploratory visualizations for further analysis

## üìä Results Summary

- Achieved **85% accuracy** on political bias classification with fine-tuned BERT.
- Clustering revealed **distinct ideological groupings** corresponding with misinformation prevalence.
- **SimCSE embeddings** outperformed traditional TF-IDF features in capturing subtle political nuances.
